# Module 1 - Overview of Cloud Computing


### 🌥️ **What is Cloud Computing?**
Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

### 🌟 **Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:**

1. **On-Demand Self-Service** 🛠️  
   Users can provision computing capabilities as needed automatically without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

2. **Broad Network Access** 🌐  
   Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through various devices (e.g., laptops, tablets, smartphones).

3. **Resource Pooling** 🏢  
   Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand, which helps in cost savings and efficiency.

4. **Rapid Elasticity** 📈📉  
   Capabilities can be scaled up or down quickly to match demand, often automatically, to ensure performance and efficiency.

5. **Measured Service** 💸  
   Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction suitable to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth). This allows for a "pay-as-you-go" pricing model.

### 💼 **Why Cloud Computing?**

- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Cloud services offer flexibility and can scale resources up or down according to the needs of the business.
- **A Business Model with the Latest Trends**: Adapts to modern business needs with cutting-edge technology.
- **Extra Bandwidth**: Provides additional bandwidth as required, helping businesses handle fluctuating demands.
- **Availability**: Ensures high availability and reliability of services.

### 🖥️ **Hypervisor:**

A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on the same physical computing resources. This transition supports a shift from CapEx (long-term investment) to OpEx (day-to-day business costs), making it appealing for businesses of all sizes.
